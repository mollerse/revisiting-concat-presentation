# Abstract

The strange and wonderful family of languages known as Concatenative Programming
Languages had its golden era with FORTH in the 70s and early 80s, after which
they largely faded from the mainstream. Relegated to being of interest for
mostly academic and niche industry applications, we could question whether these
languages still have a place in the mainstream programming world of today.

But Concatenative Languages weren't only known for their weirdly syntax-free
programs and keywords reminiscent of 90s eurodance anthems. They also came with
a remarkable, ahead of its time, philosophy of programming. They had a way of
approaching problem solving which followed naturally from the decisions made in
the design of the languages. An approach that seems very compatible with the
needs to iterate, tweak, and experiment that comes when doing creative
programming.

Let's take a fun little journey through the forgotten world of Concatenative
Languages, guided by Creative Programming.
